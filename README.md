Fashion Product Classification Project
**Overview:**

This project applies machine learning to the fashion retail domain, aiming to classify products into various categories and understand the influence of different attributes on such classifications. Utilizing a range of supervised learning techniques, we strive to gain insights that can drive data-driven decision-making in fashion retail management.

**Problem Statements:**

Classify fashion products based on attributes such as price, brand, and type.
Evaluate the performance of various machine learning models in predicting product categories.
Identify the most influential product attributes in the classification process.
Provide actionable insights to optimize inventory and marketing strategies.
Data Description:

**Source and Size**

Data Source: [Fashion Retail Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imrulhasanrobi/e-commerce-big-dataset-from-multi-category)
Data Size: 7.71 MB
Data Shape: 61201 rows Ã— 10 columns
**Variables:**

Categorical Variables
brand_name: The brand associated with the product.
title: The title or name of the product.
Gender: The target gender for the fashion product.
currency: The currency in which the prices are listed.
productCode: Unique identifier for product models.
productType: Category of the product (e.g., footwear, apparel).
cluster: Segment or group to which the product is classified based on certain characteristics.
Non-Categorical Variables
current_price: The current retail price of the product.
previous_price: The price of the product before any discount or change.
rrp: The recommended retail price of the product.
**Data Analysis:**

Descriptive Statistics

Provide summary statistics for both categorical and non-categorical variables.
Conduct a correlation analysis to identify relationships between variables.
Data Pre-Processing

Handle missing data through imputation or exclusion.
Encode categorical variables using appropriate encoding techniques.
Detect and treat outliers to prevent skewing of the model results.
Scale and transform data to prepare for machine learning algorithms.
Split data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
Model Building and Evaluation:

Implement and tune different machine learning models such as Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, SVM, and KNN.
Use various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.
Conduct feature importance analysis to determine the impact of each variable on the model predictions.
Results and Insights:

Compare the performance of all models based on the evaluation metrics.
Discuss the relevance of each variable in the models and its implication in the fashion retail context.
Derive managerial insights from the model outcomes to inform strategies in product pricing, inventory management, and marketing.
